## About Me
I’m a versatile Machine Learning Engineer with end-to-end expertise in developing AI solutions — from data ingestion and model design to deployment and optimization. I combine a strong background in machine learning, deep learning, optimization, and decision systems with a hands-on approach to building tools that make a real impact.

But beyond my professional profile, I have a genuine passion for mathematics, modeling, and experimentation. I love testing ideas, implementing algorithms, and exploring how theory can evolve into practical solutions.

This GitHub is a reflection of that passion:

🚀 Projects & Side Projects – AI applications, optimization systems, and real-world problem-solving.

📄 Paper Implementations – Reproducing and extending research to better understand and apply new methods.

🔬 Experiments – Trying out ideas, testing assumptions, and learning by building.

🛠️ Past Works – A mix of research-driven and applied contributions across industries.

Always looking to collaborate on innovative research and projects that push the boundary between theory and practice.
