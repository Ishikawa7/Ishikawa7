#### 🔭 I'm currently working as a **Machine Learning Engineer** and as a **Research Operations Analyst**.
#### 🏢 At the moment, I am working for Nicomac Europe s.r.l. ([Nicomac website](https://nicomac.com/)) on machine learning control projects and the use of machine learning in industrial processes.
#### 🌱 I'm looking to **collaborate on research-innovative projects**.
#### 💻 I'm currently working on: *machine learning control, technology transfer, deep learning models, data pipelines, deployment of AI solutions, optimization problems*.
#### 📝 I regularly: **read scientific papers and articles on machine learning and research operations**, and **prototype new systems to deal with real problems**.
#### 💬 Ask me about: **solutions to impact reality thanks to artificial intelligence**, and **making processes more efficient through optimization algorithms**.
#### 📄 Know about my experiences: [Resume](DavideGrimaldiCV.pdf)
